          A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent,
          and are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing
          you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into
          paragraphs. This is because paragraphs show a reader where the
          subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and thus help the reader see
          the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.
        </p>
        <p class="box">
          the first section of a paragraph; should include the topic sentence
          and any other sentences at the beginning of the paragraph that give
          background information or provide a transition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following paragraph illustrates this pattern of organization. In
          this paragraph the topic sentence and concluding sentence
          (CAPITALIZED) both help the reader keep the paragraph’s main point in
          mind.
        </p>
        <h3>Heading</h3>
        <p>
          Most paragraphs in an essay have a three-part structure—introduction,
          body, and conclusion. You can see this structure in paragraphs whether
          they are narrating, describing, comparing, contrasting, or analyzing
          information. Each part of the paragraph plays an important role in
          communicating your meaning to your reader.
        </p>
        <h3>Sub-heading</h3>
        <p>
          follows the introduction; discusses the controlling idea, using facts,
          arguments, analysis, examples, and other information.
        </p>
        <p class="box">Example code Block</p>
        <p>
          In a coherent paragraph, each sentence relates clearly to the topic
          sentence or controlling idea, but there is more to coherence than
          this. If a paragraph is coherent, each sentence flows smoothly into
          the next without obvious shifts or jumps. A coherent paragraph also
          highlights the ties between old information and new information to
          make the structure of ideas or arguments clear to the reader.
        </p>
        <div class="sub" id="Sub-heading">
            <h3>Sub-heading</h3>
        <p>
          Transitional expressions emphasize the relationships between ideas, so
          they help readers follow your train of thought or see connections that
          they might otherwise miss or misunderstand. The following paragraph
          shows how carefully chosen transitions (CAPITALIZED) lead the reader
          smoothly from the introduction to the conclusion of the paragraph.
