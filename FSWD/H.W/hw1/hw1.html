          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>
            The first Linux prototypes were publicly released on the Internet in
            late 1991 from an FTP server at his university.[8][24] Version 1.0
            was released on 14 March 1994.[25] Torvalds first encountered the
            GNU Project in the autumn of 1991 when another Swedish-speaking
            computer science student, Lars Wirzenius, took him to the University
            of Technology to listen to free software guru Richard Stallman's
            speech. Because of the talk and pressure from other contributors,
            Torvalds would ultimately switch his original license (which forbade
            commercial use) to Stallman's GNU General Public License version 2
            (GPLv2) for his Linux kernel.
